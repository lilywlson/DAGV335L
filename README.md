# DAGV335L

[LAB01] This was a model created in zbrush as an aquatic "monopedal" creature. 
Most of the sculpting process was figuring out which body shapes I liked and figuring out how to smooth out different areas of the model so that it didn't look bumpy.
I mainly just used the basic tools provided in zbrush, like the different brush sizes and textures as well as the smoothing effect.
I couldn't quite get the model "smooth" enough? I guess, the thing just looks bumpy and ridged all over in a way that I feel an aquatic creature shouldn't be, but I was unsure how to fix it.

[LAB02] This was a model I had created in zbrush and then retopo'd and refined in Maya.
Most of the rigging process was simple, except for the hair. Each hair piece were extended cylinders that were connected to these plates on the back of the head. I decided to section the pieces and rig them with joint pieces so that the hair could be moved with the model so that it didn't clip through anything. 
The issues I had came to the skin painting. I think I generally had really good deformation in the limbs when it came to movement, but the midsection has some stretching to it that doesn't seem natural when the rig is moved too far.
