# DAGV335L

This was a model created in zbrush as an aquatic "monopedal" creature. 
Most of the sculpting process was figuring out which body shapes I liked and figuring out how to smooth out different areas of the model so that it didn't look bumpy.
I mainly just used the basic tools provided in zbrush, like the different brush sizes and textures as well as the smoothing effect.
I couldn't quite get the model "smooth" enough? I guess, the thing just looks bumpy and ridged all over in a way that I feel an aquatic creature shouldn't be, but I was unsure how to fix it.
